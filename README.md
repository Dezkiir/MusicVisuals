# Music Visualiser Project

Name: Dylan Deakin

Student Number: C18339746

## Instructions
- Fork this repository and use it a starter project for your assignment
- Create a new package named your student number and put all your code in this package.
- You should start by creating a subclass of ie.tudublin.Visual
- There is an example visualiser called MyVisual in the example package
- Check out the WaveForm and AudioBandsVisual for examples of how to call the Processing functions from other classes that are not subclasses of PApplet

# Description of the assignment
- Music Visual with reactive circle depending on audio. 
- Uses Beat Detect and Minim libraries. 
- File takes in audio and analyses the Meta Data of the wav file.
- Using this data it reacts to both the breat and the amp of the sound. 
- The project also has the time remaining of the song visible in the file.
- Backgrounds have been loaded into the program to help *liven* up the image.

# Instructions
- Click once if you wish to remove background and visual, then see remaining song time.

# How it works
- Takes in Audio FIle (Using the Minim Library)
- Between the Beat Detect and Minim it loads the file.
- Beat Detect *detects the beat* as the name states
- Using minim I was able to get the meta data of the file to help create the audio buffer needed to play the file.

# What I am most proud of in the assignment
I am most proud of the centre visual. I am not the best when it comes to mapping audio signals to change the X and Y values of lines. I further added onto this by adding connecting lines and the centre circle which helps visualise the centrepoint of the circle. It's a pretty basic file but I was really satisfied with the outcome, however I do wish I could've implemented my Tunnel.java program.
